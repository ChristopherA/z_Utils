## Core Task File

All tasks are tracked in a single file: `WORK_STREAM_TASKS.md`

This file is organized by:
1. Active tasks by category
2. Branch-specific task sections
3. Completed tasks

## Task States

Tasks have three possible states:
- `[ ]` - Not started
- `[~]` - In progress (with start date in YYYY-MM-DD format)
- `[x]` - Completed (with completion date in YYYY-MM-DD format)

Example:
```markdown
- [ ] Create user authentication system
- [~] Implement password reset (started 2025-03-19)
- [x] Add login form (completed 2025-03-19)
```

## Task Organization

Tasks should be organized in this structure:

```markdown
# Z_Utils - Work Stream Tasks

> - _created: <!-- START_DATE -->_
> - _last-updated: <!-- UPDATE_DATE -->_

## Active Tasks

### Project Setup
- [ ] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2

### Core Development
- [ ] Task 3
- [ ] Task 4

## Branch: feature/name
- [~] Current branch task 1
- [ ] Current branch task 2

## Branch: fix/issue
- [~] Bug fix task

## Development Process
[Process documentation - how tasks are handled]

## Task Dependencies and Critical Path
[Task dependencies - critical path information]

## Completed Tasks
<!-- No entries yet -->
```

<!-- Note for Claude: When helping users set up their project, replace the START_DATE placeholders with the actual project creation date in YYYY-MM-DD format -->

## Task Management Workflow

### Starting a Task

1. Find the task in WORK_STREAM_TASKS.md
2. Move it to the appropriate branch section
3. Change its state to in-progress `[~]`
4. Add a "started" date (YYYY-MM-DD format)

### Working on a Task

1. Keep the task state as `[~]`
2. Update the task with progress notes as needed
3. Break down large tasks into subtasks if necessary

### Completing a Task

1. Change the task state to completed `[x]`
2. Add the completion date in parentheses (YYYY-MM-DD format)
3. Add a brief implementation summary
4. Move the task to the "Completed Tasks" section

## Task Creation Guidelines

### Good Task Descriptions

Tasks should be:
- **Specific**: Clearly defined scope
- **Measurable**: Clear completion criteria
- **Achievable**: Can be completed in a reasonable time
- **Relevant**: Directly related to project goals

### Task Format

```
- [ ] [Action verb] [specific deliverable] - [optional context]
```

Examples for Z_Utils tasks:
```
- [ ] Document z_Output function with comprehensive examples
- [ ] Create function test for z_Check_Dependencies
- [ ] Modernize error handling in example scripts
```

## Z_Utils Task Types

For the Z_Utils project, tasks generally fall into these categories:

### Documentation Tasks
- Function documentation
- Usage examples
- API references
- Architecture documentation

### Testing Tasks
- Function test creation
- Test automation
- Test reporting
- Regression test improvement

### Development Tasks
- Function implementation
- Bug fixing
- Performance optimization
- Feature enhancement

### Process Tasks
- CI/CD setup
- Release management
- Development workflow improvement
- Code review process

## Claude's Role in Task Tracking

Claude will help with task management by:

1. Identifying current tasks when starting a session
2. Updating task status during work
3. Moving completed tasks to the completed section
4. Adding implementation details to completed tasks
5. Suggesting next tasks based on dependencies
6. Helping maintain critical path information
7. Synchronizing task tracking with context changes

## Context Synchronization

When contexts are archived or refactored, ensure WORK_STREAM_TASKS.md remains synchronized:

### Task Tracking for Archived Contexts

1. **Keep historical references to completed work**:
   - Completed tasks associated with archived contexts remain in WORK_STREAM_TASKS.md
   - Historical references maintain project continuity and progress tracking
   - Include completion dates for all archived work

2. **Update branch references**:
   - When a branch is archived, ensure any tasks still referencing it are updated
   - Tasks that depend on archived work should reference the appropriate active branches
   - Any future tasks that built on archived contexts should be updated

3. **Refactor task sections as needed**:
   - When contexts are refactored (e.g., split or combined), refactor corresponding task sections
   - Maintain the same task breakdown structure but update branch references
   - Update dependency chains to reflect new branch relationships
   - Ensure acceptance criteria matches current context scope

### Synchronization Process

When significant context changes occur:

1. Use the following command to synchronize task tracking:
   ```bash
   claude "load CLAUDE.md, verify current branch is main, synchronize WORK_STREAM_TASKS.md with context changes, and continue work"
   ```

2. Claude will:
   - Update branch references in WORK_STREAM_TASKS.md
   - Ensure task sections align with current contexts
   - Maintain historical completed work
   - Update task dependencies as needed
   - Preserve completion dates and implementation details

<!-- Note for Claude: When updating the WORK_STREAM_TASKS.md file, ensure you update the last-updated date and maintain consistent formatting. Always use YYYY-MM-DD format for all dates. When synchronizing tasks with archived contexts, always preserve historical completed work while updating references to active branches. -->
