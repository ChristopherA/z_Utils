## Purpose and Goal

This context documents the test infrastructure improvements that were necessary to support the renaming and enhancement of the inception scripts. The focus was on ensuring that the regression tests continue to work reliably after script renaming and relocation.

## Current Status

The critical test infrastructure improvements needed for the renamed inception scripts have been completed and are included in this PR. More advanced testing features have been deferred to a future branch (feature/enhanced-sandbox-testing).

## Core Issues Addressed

### 1. ANSI Color Code Handling in Regression Tests

The regression tests for the inception scripts needed better ANSI color code handling to ensure consistent results after renaming and relocation:

- Updated the test output stripping to handle ANSI color codes consistently
- Improved pattern matching to be less sensitive to color code variations
- Enhanced test reporting to clearly show test results

### 2. Script Relocation Support

Modified the test infrastructure to handle the relocation of scripts:

- Updated path resolution for relocated scripts
- Ensured test output comparisons work with the new script names
- Added support for recording and validating test output

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Test Output Handling

- Added better ANSI code stripping for test result comparison
- Improved output normalization for consistent test results
- Created regression test output capture for future reference

### 2. Script Renaming Support

- Updated all test references to use the new script names
- Modified test expectations to match the renamed scripts' output
- Created `setup_git_inception_repo_REGRESSION_output.txt` to document expected output

## Files Included in PR

The following test-related files are included in this PR:

1. `src/examples/tests/setup_git_inception_repo_REGRESSION.sh` (renamed from TEST-create_inception_commit.sh)
2. `src/examples/tests/setup_git_inception_repo_REGRESSION_output.txt` (new file)

## Future Enhancements

While the current implementation addresses the immediate needs for the inception script regression tests, several enhancements have been identified for future work:

1. Create comprehensive integration tests for the ANSI stripping functions
2. Standardize the pattern matching approach across all regression tests
3. Investigate and fix test_new_functions.sh hanging in sandbox environment
4. Enhance test suite organization and reporting

These enhancements have been documented in `contexts/futures/feature-enhanced-sandbox-testing-context.md` for future implementation.
