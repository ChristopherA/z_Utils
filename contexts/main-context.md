# Main Branch Context

## Current Status
- Current branch: main
- Started: 2025-03-19
- Progress: Ready for workflow management and branch orchestration

## Branch Protection Notice
**IMPORTANT**: The main branch has protection rules that prevent direct commits. All changes must be made via feature branches and pull requests.

## Main Branch Purpose
The main branch serves as the coordination point for project management and should NOT contain direct development work. Its primary functions are:

1. PR review and merge management
2. Branch orchestration and context switching
3. Work stream task organization and planning

## Active Pull Requests
<!-- List active PRs that need review/merge attention -->
- [~] PR #7: "Organize tasks and create future branch contexts" - Needs revision (2025-03-22)

## Active Branches
<!-- List active branches with their status -->
- [~] organize/task-planning-final - Task planning revision (2025-03-22)
- [ ] feature/function-documentation - Function documentation (high priority - next up on critical path)
- [ ] feature/test-coverage - Test implementation (high priority - follows documentation)
- [ ] feature/modernize-scripts - Script modernization (medium priority - independent)
- [ ] feature/enhanced-functionality - Enhanced features (medium priority - depends on tests)
- [ ] feature/ci-cd-setup - CI/CD implementation (low priority - depends on tests)

## Available Context Files
<!-- List context files without branches that can be started -->
- contexts/futures/feature-function-documentation-context.md - High priority (critical path)
- contexts/futures/feature-test-coverage-context.md - High priority (critical path)

## Key Decisions
- [2025-03-19] Project will follow team development model
- [2025-03-19] Branch protection rules enabled for main branch
- [2025-03-19] All Z_Utils functions maintained in _Z_Utils.zsh file
- [2025-03-22] Process updates from toolkit incorporated with PR #4
- [2025-03-22] Task organization completed with critical path identification
- [2025-03-22] Future branch context files created and stored in contexts/futures/

## Notes
### Critical Path
The critical path for Z_Utils development has been identified as:
1. Core Infrastructure and Standards → Foundation for all other work
2. Function Documentation → Essential for understanding behavior
3. Test Coverage → Builds on documentation for reliable enhancement
4. Enhanced Functionality → Relies on solid documentation and testing

### Task Categories
Tasks have been organized into these primary categories:
1. Core Infrastructure and Standards (Foundation)
2. Core Function Documentation and Testing (Functionality)
3. Script Refactoring and Testing (Parallel Workstreams)
4. Future Projects (Dependent on Prior Work)

## Special Workflows

### PR Review and Merge Process
```bash
claude "load CLAUDE.md, verify current branch is main, review PR #[number], and merge if approved"
```

### Branch Switching
```bash
claude "load CLAUDE.md, verify current branch is main, switch to branch [branch-name], and continue work"
```

### Work Stream Management
```bash
claude "load CLAUDE.md, verify current branch is main, and organize WORK_STREAM_TASKS.md"
```

### Context Archiving
```bash
claude "load CLAUDE.md, verify current branch is main, archive completed context [context-name], and update documentation"
```

### Starting Next Critical Path Item
```bash
claude "load CLAUDE.md, verify current branch is main, copy contexts/futures/feature-function-documentation-context.md to contexts/, create branch feature/function-documentation, and begin working on function documentation"
```
