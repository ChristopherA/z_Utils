# Organize Task Planning Final Context

## Current Status
- Current branch: organize/task-planning-final
- Started: 2025-03-22
- Progress: In progress - Nearing completion

## Scope Boundaries
- Primary Purpose: Reorganize project tasks and create context files for future branches
- In Scope: 
  - Update WORK_STREAM_TASKS.md with improved structure
  - Create detailed context files for future branches
  - Add acceptance criteria for tasks
  - Clarify task dependencies and critical path
  - Create organize-task-planning-summary.md
  - Update main context with task planning results
- Out of Scope:
  - Implementation of tasks (will be done in respective branches)
  - Documentation changes unrelated to task planning
  - Process improvements beyond task organization
  - Actual creation of future branches
- Dependencies:
  - None - This is an independent task

## Completed Work
- [x] Created detailed context files for all future branches (2025-03-22)
  - feature/function-documentation-context.md
  - feature/test-coverage-context.md
  - feature/modernize-scripts-context.md
  - feature/enhanced-functionality-context.md
  - feature/ci-cd-setup-context.md
- [x] Updated WORK_STREAM_TASKS.md with improved structure (2025-03-22)
- [x] Added acceptance criteria for major tasks (2025-03-22)
- [x] Created organize-task-planning-summary.md with overview (2025-03-22)
- [x] Updated main-context.md with task planning results (2025-03-22)

## Current Tasks
- [~] Organize task planning (started 2025-03-22)
  - [x] Review existing tasks and identify task categories (2025-03-22)
  - [x] Identify dependencies between tasks (2025-03-22)
  - [x] Determine critical path for development (2025-03-22)
  - [x] Create task acceptance criteria (2025-03-22)
  - [x] Create future branch context files (2025-03-22)
  - [x] Update main context with task planning results (2025-03-22)
  - [~] Create PR for task planning changes (started 2025-03-22)

## Key Decisions
- [2025-03-22] Organized tasks into clear categories with dependencies
- [2025-03-22] Identified critical path: Core Infrastructure → Function Documentation → Test Coverage → Enhanced Functionality
- [2025-03-22] Created detailed future branch context files with scope boundaries
- [2025-03-22] Added comprehensive acceptance criteria for major tasks
- [2025-03-22] Created organize-task-planning-summary.md with overview of changes

## Notes
### Task Organization Structure
Tasks have been organized into these primary categories:
1. Core Infrastructure and Standards (foundation)
2. Core Function Documentation and Testing (functionality)
3. Script Refactoring and Testing (parallel work)
4. Future Projects (dependent on prior work)

### Critical Path Analysis
The critical path for Z_Utils development has been identified as:
1. Core Infrastructure and Standards → Foundation for all other work
2. Function Documentation → Essential for understanding behavior
3. Test Coverage → Builds on documentation for reliable enhancement
4. Enhanced Functionality → Relies on solid documentation and testing

## Error Recovery
- If PR needs revision: Address feedback without altering fundamental structure
- If context files have issues: Update individually without redoing entire task
- If WORK_STREAM_TASKS.md changes conflict: Focus on preserving task details

## Restart Instructions
To continue this work:
```bash
claude "load CLAUDE.md, verify current branch is organize/task-planning-final, load appropriate context, and continue organizing project tasks"
```
