## Key Decisions
- No script files will be modified in this branch
- No changes to files in ./requirements/guides/ will be made
- Keep the essential .gitkeep files that are still needed

## Notes
The project has already been initialized with Git, so the bootstrap.md file is no longer needed. This cleanup will ensure a cleaner repository structure and more accurate documentation.
