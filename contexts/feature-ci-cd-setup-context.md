## Development Steps
1. Create the branch from main after test coverage is established
2. Set up GitHub Actions workflows
3. Configure automated testing and linting
4. Implement release management process
5. Document CI/CD process
6. Create PR to merge into main

## Restart Instructions
To work on this branch:
```bash
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout -b feature/ci-cd-setup
claude "load CLAUDE.md, identify branch as feature/ci-cd-setup, and continue working on CI/CD setup"
```

## Notes
- This work depends on good test coverage to be valuable
- CI configuration should be as portable as possible
- Release process should follow semantic versioning
- Consider different test environments (macOS, Linux)
- Documentation should be clear enough for contributors to understand the CI process
- Test workflows thoroughly before merging
