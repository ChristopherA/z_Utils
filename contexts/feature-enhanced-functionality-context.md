- Progress: Not started - context file prepared
- Repository DID: did:repo:b0c5cd0d85b29543c604c093dd83a1a20eb17af1

## Branch Purpose
This branch will focus on adding enhanced functionality to the Z_Utils library beyond the core utilities. It will implement advanced logging capabilities, configuration management, and process management utilities.

## Tasks
- [ ] **Advanced Logging**
  - [ ] Design advanced logging architecture
  - [ ] Implement log rotation functionality
  - [ ] Add log levels and filtering
  - [ ] Create log file management functions
  - [ ] Document logging functions

- [ ] **Configuration Management**
  - [ ] Design configuration system
  - [ ] Implement config file parsing
  - [ ] Create functions for storing/retrieving configuration
  - [ ] Add validation for configuration values
  - [ ] Document configuration system

- [ ] **Process Management**
  - [ ] Create process control utilities
  - [ ] Implement background job management
  - [ ] Add process monitoring functions
  - [ ] Create IPC helper functions
  - [ ] Document process management functions

- [ ] **Extended Examples**
  - [ ] Create complex usage examples
  - [ ] Document best practices for advanced features
  - [ ] Create multi-function example workflows

## Development Steps
1. Create the branch from main after core functions are documented and tested
2. Design and implement enhanced logging features
3. Add configuration management system
4. Implement process management utilities
5. Create comprehensive examples
6. Create PR to merge into main

## Restart Instructions
To work on this branch:
```bash
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout -b feature/enhanced-functionality
claude "load CLAUDE.md, identify branch as feature/enhanced-functionality, and continue working on enhanced Z_Utils features"
```

## Notes
- These features depend on solid documentation and testing of core functions
- Each new feature should have its own test suite
- Design for backward compatibility with existing functions
- Follow the established coding patterns and documentation standards
- All new features should have comprehensive example scripts
