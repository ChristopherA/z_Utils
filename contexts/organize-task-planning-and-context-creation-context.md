# Organize Task Planning and Context Creation Context

## Current Status
- Current branch: organize/task-planning-and-context-creation
- Started: 2025-03-22
- Progress: Complete, ready for review

## Scope Boundaries
- Primary Purpose: Organize, flesh out, and prioritize tasks for Z_Utils development and create context files for future branches
- In Scope: 
  - Review current WORK_STREAM_TASKS.md and identify task groups
  - Create detailed task breakdowns for each development area
  - Prioritize tasks based on dependencies and project goals
  - Create context files for future branches using the enhanced template
  - Establish clear task ownership and dependencies
  - Define acceptance criteria for major tasks
- Out of Scope:
  - Actual implementation of tasks (code, documentation, tests)
  - Changes to the core Z_Utils functionality
  - Modifications to completed work
- Dependencies:
  - Builds on the enhanced process improvements from PR #4
  - Requires understanding of Z_Utils architecture and goals

<!-- Task format: 
- [ ] Not started
- [~] In progress (with start date in YYYY-MM-DD format)
- [x] Completed (with completion date in YYYY-MM-DD format)

## Key Decisions
- [2025-03-22] Organized tasks into five major categories: Project Setup, Core Library, Script Enhancement, Documentation, and Automation
- [2025-03-22] Identified critical path: Function Documentation → Test Coverage → Enhanced Functionality
- [2025-03-22] Created context files for all planned future branches
- [2025-03-22] Added acceptance criteria to all major tasks
- [2025-03-22] Placed context files in contexts/futures/ directory until branches are created

## Notes
### Reference Information
- WORK_STREAM_TASKS.md contains the current task breakdown
- Enhanced context template now requires scope boundaries
- The project follows a Team development model

### Untracked Files References
<!-- No untracked files yet -->

## Error Recovery
- If tasks exceed original scope: Split into multiple branches by task group
- If priorities conflict: Focus on critical path tasks first
- If dependencies are unclear: Document assumptions and request clarification

## Restart Instructions
To continue this work:
```bash
claude "load CLAUDE.md, verify current branch is organize/task-planning-and-context-creation, load appropriate context, and continue task planning"
```
