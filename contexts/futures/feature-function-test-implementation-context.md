# Feature Function Test Implementation Context

## Current Status
- Current branch: feature/function-test-implementation
- Started: <!-- Will be filled when branch is created -->
- Progress: Planned, not started

## Scope Boundaries
- Primary Purpose: Implement comprehensive test coverage for all Z_Utils library functions
- In Scope: 
  - Create test scripts for all functions without existing tests
  - Enhance existing test scripts for better coverage
  - Implement test cases for core functionality
  - Test edge cases and error handling for each function
  - Achieve high test coverage across the library
- Out of Scope:
  - Test infrastructure and framework development (covered in feature/test-infrastructure)
  - Function documentation (covered in feature/function-documentation)
  - New functionality implementation (covered in feature/enhanced-functionality)
  - CI/CD integration (will use tests but is implemented in feature/ci-cd-setup)
- Dependencies:
  - feature/test-infrastructure - Requires the test infrastructure to be in place
  - feature/function-documentation - Tests will be more effective with complete documentation

## Background

This context evolved from the original test-coverage context, now focusing specifically on implementing tests for individual functions rather than the testing infrastructure itself.

## Current Tasks

### 1. Core Utility Function Tests
- [ ] Create/enhance test for z_Output
  - [ ] Test all message types (info, warning, error, success)
  - [ ] Test formatting options
  - [ ] Test edge cases (long messages, special characters)
  - [ ] Test verbosity controls
- [ ] Create/enhance test for z_Report_Error
  - [ ] Test error message formatting
  - [ ] Test exit code handling
  - [ ] Test integration with z_Output
  - [ ] Test stack trace functionality
- [ ] Create test for z_Check_Dependencies
  - [ ] Test with required dependencies present
  - [ ] Test with missing required dependencies
  - [ ] Test with optional dependencies missing
  - [ ] Test custom error messages

### 2. Environment Function Tests
- [ ] Create test for z_Setup_Environment
  - [ ] Test environment initialization
  - [ ] Test version checking
  - [ ] Test dependency validation
  - [ ] Test custom initialization
- [ ] Create test for z_Cleanup
  - [ ] Test normal cleanup flow
  - [ ] Test error condition cleanup
  - [ ] Test temporary file removal
  - [ ] Test cleanup hooks

### 3. Path Handling Function Tests
- [ ] Create/enhance test for z_Convert_Path_To_Relative
  - [ ] Test various path scenarios
  - [ ] Test edge cases
  - [ ] Test with dot paths (., ..)
  - [ ] Test with absolute vs relative inputs
- [ ] Create/enhance test for z_Ensure_Parent_Path_Exists
  - [ ] Test creating parent directories
  - [ ] Test with existing paths
  - [ ] Test error handling for invalid paths
  - [ ] Test with permission restrictions

### 4. Git Function Tests
- [ ] Create/enhance test for z_Create_Inception_Repository
  - [ ] Test basic repository creation
  - [ ] Test with custom configurations
  - [ ] Test error handling
- [ ] Create/enhance test for z_Get_Repository_DID
  - [ ] Test DID generation
  - [ ] Test with various repository states
  - [ ] Test error handling
- [ ] Create/enhance test for z_Verify_Git_Repository
  - [ ] Test with valid repositories
  - [ ] Test with invalid/corrupt repositories
  - [ ] Test with various repository states
- [ ] Create/enhance test for z_Verify_Git_Config
  - [ ] Test with valid git configurations
  - [ ] Test with missing configurations
  - [ ] Test with various user settings

### 5. Additional Function Tests
- [ ] Identify and implement tests for remaining functions
  - [ ] List all functions in _Z_Utils.zsh
  - [ ] Prioritize based on complexity and usage
  - [ ] Implement tests with consistent approach
  - [ ] Ensure each function has appropriate coverage

## Key Decisions
- Tests will use the infrastructure from feature/test-infrastructure
- Each function will have a dedicated test file with comprehensive test cases
- Both success paths and error paths will be tested for each function
- Tests will be designed to be maintainable and environment-independent

## Notes

### Function Test Files
The following function test files were developed during previous work and are stored in the untracked directory:

- `src/function_tests/z_Create_Inception_Repository_test.sh`
- `src/function_tests/z_Ensure_Allowed_Signers_test.sh`
- `src/function_tests/z_Extract_SSH_Key_Fingerprint_test.sh`
- `src/function_tests/z_Get_First_Commit_Hash_test.sh`
- `src/function_tests/z_Get_Git_Config_test.sh`
- `src/function_tests/z_Get_Repository_DID_test.sh`
- `src/function_tests/z_Setup_Git_Environment_test.sh`
- `src/function_tests/z_Verify_Commit_Signature_test.sh`
- `src/function_tests/z_Verify_Git_Config_test.sh`
- `src/function_tests/z_Verify_Git_Repository_test.sh`

These files can be retrieved from `untracked/enhanced-sandbox-testing/src/function_tests/` when work on this feature begins.
