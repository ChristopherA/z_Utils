# Feature Test Infrastructure Context

## Current Status
- Current branch: feature/test-infrastructure
- Started: <!-- Will be filled when branch is created -->
- Progress: Planned, not started

## Scope Boundaries
- Primary Purpose: Develop comprehensive test infrastructure for Z_Utils library
- In Scope: 
  - Create standardized testing environment and framework
  - Implement test runner and reporting mechanism
  - Fix sandbox testing issues and ANSI handling
  - Standardize pattern matching and test assertions
  - Create documentation for test infrastructure
- Out of Scope:
  - Implementation of individual function tests (covered in feature/function-test-implementation)
  - Function documentation (covered in feature/function-documentation)
  - CI/CD configuration (will use this infrastructure but implementation in feature/ci-cd-setup)
- Dependencies:
  - None - This should be implemented first as other testing work depends on it

## Background

This context originated from the enhanced-sandbox-testing context and now focuses specifically on establishing the test infrastructure. Several issues were identified during the refactoring of inception scripts that need to be addressed to provide a solid foundation for all testing.

## Current Tasks

### 1. Testing Environment Setup
- [ ] Create sandbox testing environment
  - [ ] Set up isolated directory structure for test repos
  - [ ] Create clean-up mechanisms for test artifacts
  - [ ] Implement safeguards against affecting real repositories
  - [ ] Document testing environment approach
- [ ] Implement repository testing utilities
  - [ ] Create test repo creation functions
  - [ ] Add repository state manipulation utilities
  - [ ] Create verification utilities
- [ ] Fix sandbox environment issues
  - [ ] Address test hanging in sandbox mode
  - [ ] Implement proper timeouts for all test operations
  - [ ] Add debugging capabilities for sandbox execution
  - [ ] Address resource constraints in sandbox environments

### 2. Test Framework Development
- [ ] Define test architecture and structure
  - [ ] Research Zsh testing frameworks and patterns
  - [ ] Define test file organization and naming conventions
  - [ ] Establish test result reporting standards
- [ ] Implement test automation
  - [ ] Create test runner script with categorization (unit, integration, regression)
  - [ ] Implement test discovery
  - [ ] Add summary reporting capabilities
  - [ ] Add parallel test execution where appropriate
- [ ] Implement comprehensive ANSI handling
  - [ ] Create a dedicated test suite for ANSI stripping functionality
  - [ ] Implement environment detection for optimal stripping
  - [ ] Add support for all common terminal control sequences
- [ ] Standardize pattern matching
  - [ ] Create a unified pattern matching framework
  - [ ] Add support for exact matches, regex, and fuzzy matching
  - [ ] Add helpers for common matching scenarios

### 3. Test Documentation
- [ ] Document testing approach
  - [ ] Create test writing guide
  - [ ] Document test environment setup requirements
  - [ ] Document test execution process
  - [ ] Provide troubleshooting information for common test failures
  - [ ] Document test reporting interpretation

## Key Decisions
- Test infrastructure will be implemented before function tests
- Testing environment will prioritize safety over performance
- Test framework will support both individual and suite-based execution
- Standard test reporting format will be implemented for all tests

## Notes

### Identified Issues

#### 1. ANSI Stripping Inconsistencies
During the refactoring of the inception scripts, we observed inconsistent behavior in how ANSI color codes are stripped in different test environments. While basic functionality works, there are edge cases that require more robust handling:
- Terminal control sequences beyond basic color codes may not be handled correctly
- Different environments (macOS, Linux) may require different stripping techniques
- Pattern matching that relies on stripped output needs to be more flexible

#### 2. Test Hanging in Sandbox Mode
The `test_new_functions.sh` script currently hangs when run in sandbox mode. Initial investigation suggests this could be related to:
- Process isolation in the sandbox environment
- Potential infinite loops or deadlocks when specific environment variables are set
- Resource limitations or timeouts that occur only in sandboxed execution

#### 3. Pattern Matching Standardization Needed
Different regression tests currently use slightly different approaches to pattern matching:
- Some use exact string matching
- Others use pipe-delimited OR syntax
- Some include case sensitivity while others don't
- Error message matching can be brittle when implementation details change

### Files for Reference
The following files were developed during refactoring work and are stored in the untracked directory:

#### Test Infrastructure Files
- `src/tests/README.md`
- `src/tests/ansi_test.sh`
- `src/tests/basic_test.sh`
- `src/tests/minimal_test.sh`
- `src/tests/setup_test_environment.sh`
- `src/tests/simple_sandbox_test.sh`
- `src/tests/simple_test.sh`
- `src/tests/simple_test_helpers.zsh`
- `src/tests/test_new_functions.sh`
