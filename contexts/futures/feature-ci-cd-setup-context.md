## Notes
### Reference Information
- GitHub Actions documentation
- Similar projects with CI/CD setup
- Test framework from feature/test-coverage

### CI/CD Goals
- Automated validation of all PRs
- Comprehensive test coverage reporting
- Seamless release process
- Consistent code quality enforcement

## Error Recovery
- If GitHub Actions limitations are discovered: Consider alternative CI platforms
- If automated testing fails: Document manual testing procedures
- If release process automation is complex: Break into manual and automated phases

## Restart Instructions
