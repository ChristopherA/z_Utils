# Feature CI/CD Setup Context

<!-- 
IMPORTANT DESIGN DECISIONS:
1. This template prioritizes Claude processing efficiency over human readability
2. Direct command execution (git status, etc.) is used for reliable state detection
3. Process blocks use a single, consistent format for Claude's internal use
4. Instructions are self-contained without requiring cross-referencing

## Current Status
- Current branch: feature/ci-cd-setup
- Started: <!-- Will be filled when branch is created -->
- Last updated: 2025-03-31
- Progress: Planned, not started
- Phase: Planning

## Planning

### What We're Solving
We need to implement a continuous integration and deployment pipeline to ensure reliable testing, validation, and deployment of Z_Utils library changes.

### Our Approach
We'll set up GitHub Actions workflows to automate testing, linting, and release management, with specific workflows for PR validation, scheduled tests, and versioned releases.

### Definition of Done
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflows fully configured and operational
- [ ] PR validation process automated with status checks
- [ ] Test execution automated on multiple platforms
- [ ] Release process documented and standardized

### Implementation Phases
1. Research and Prepare → GitHub Actions capabilities assessed
2. Configure Test Infrastructure → Test execution automated
3. Set Up Workflows → Multiple workflows operational
4. Create Metrics → Code quality monitoring implemented

### Approval
- [ ] Planning approved - Ready to implement (YYYY-MM-DD)

## Scope Boundaries
- Primary Purpose: Implement continuous integration and deployment pipeline for Z_Utils
- In Scope: 
  - Set up GitHub Actions workflow
  - Implement automated testing
  - Configure linting and style checks
  - Define release process
  - Implement version tagging
  - Create release notes template
  - Create changelog management process
- Out of Scope:
  - Function documentation (covered in feature/function-documentation)
  - Test creation (covered in feature/test-infrastructure and feature/function-test-implementation)
  - Script modernization (covered in feature/modernize-scripts)
  - Enhanced functionality (covered in feature/enhanced-functionality)
- Dependencies:
  - Function test implementation for automated testing
  - Test infrastructure for CI integration
  - Documentation for release notes generation

## Key Decisions
<!-- No entries yet -->

## Notes
### Reference Information
- GitHub Actions documentation
- Similar projects with CI/CD setup
- Test framework from feature/test-infrastructure

### CI/CD Goals
- Automated validation of all PRs
- Comprehensive test coverage reporting
- Seamless release process
- Consistent code quality enforcement

## Error Recovery
- If GitHub Actions limitations are discovered: Consider alternative CI platforms
- If automated testing fails: Document manual testing procedures
- If release process automation is complex: Break into manual and automated phases

## Restart Instructions
To continue this work:
```bash
claude "load CLAUDE.md, verify current branch is feature/ci-cd-setup, load appropriate context, and continue setting up CI/CD for Z_Utils"
