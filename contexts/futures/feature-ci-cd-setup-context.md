# Feature: CI/CD Setup Context

## Current Status
- Current branch: feature/ci-cd-setup
- Not yet started
- Priority: Low (Depends on Test Coverage)

## Scope Boundaries
- Primary Purpose: Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment
- In Scope: 
  - Configure GitHub Actions workflows
  - Implement automated testing
  - Set up linting and style checking
  - Create release process automation
  - Document CI/CD procedures
- Out of Scope:
  - Extensive test refactoring
  - Complex deployment scenarios
  - Integration with external CI/CD systems
- Dependencies:
  - Requires comprehensive test coverage
  - Needs standardized testing approaches

## Notes
### Reference Information
- GitHub Actions offers CI/CD capabilities
- Test scripts should be compatible with automated execution
- Shell scripts can be linted with tools like shellcheck

### Untracked Files References
<!-- No untracked files yet -->

## Error Recovery
- If CI integration is complex, start with simple test execution
- If automated tests fail in CI but pass locally, focus on environment differences

## Restart Instructions
