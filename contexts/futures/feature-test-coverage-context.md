# Feature Test Coverage Context

## Current Status
- Current branch: feature/test-coverage
- Started: <!-- Will be filled when branch is created -->
- Progress: Planned, not started

## Scope Boundaries
- Primary Purpose: Implement comprehensive test coverage for all Z_Utils library functions
- In Scope: 
  - Create test scripts for all functions without existing tests
  - Enhance existing test scripts for better coverage
  - Implement test automation framework
  - Document testing approach and standards
  - Create test reporting capabilities
- Out of Scope:
  - Function documentation (covered in feature/function-documentation)
  - Script modernization (covered in feature/modernize-scripts)
  - New functionality implementation (covered in feature/enhanced-functionality)
  - CI/CD integration (will use tests but is implemented in feature/ci-cd-setup)
- Dependencies:
  - None - Can be started independently, but will be more effective after documentation is complete

## Key Decisions
<!-- No entries yet -->

## Notes
### Reference Information
- Existing tests: src/function_tests/*.sh
- Main library: src/_Z_Utils.zsh
- Examples that show function usage: src/examples/*.sh

### Testing Approach
- Tests should verify:
  - Function success paths
  - Function error handling
  - Edge cases and boundary conditions
  - Integration with other functions
  - Return values and exit codes

## Error Recovery
- If test dependencies are missing: Document requirements and installation steps
- If tests uncover function behavior issues: Document in test results but do not modify function behavior
- If test environment is unstable: Create isolated test environment with proper setup/teardown

## Restart Instructions
To continue this work:
```bash
claude "load CLAUDE.md, verify current branch is feature/test-coverage, load appropriate context, and continue implementing Z_Utils tests"
```
