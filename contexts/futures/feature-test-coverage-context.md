# Feature: Test Coverage Context

## Current Status
- Current branch: feature/test-coverage
- Not yet started
- Priority: High (Part of Critical Path)

## Scope Boundaries
- Primary Purpose: Implement comprehensive test coverage for all Z_Utils functions and scripts
- In Scope: 
  - Create sandbox testing infrastructure for safe git operations
  - Update existing function tests to conform to requirements
  - Fix regression test for create_inception_commit.sh
  - Create regression test for create_github_remote.sh
  - Create regression test for audit_inception_commit-POC.sh
  - Standardize testing approaches across the project
- Out of Scope:
  - CI/CD integration
  - Performance optimization
  - Extensive refactoring of functions (beyond what's needed for testing)
- Dependencies:
  - Requires completion of function documentation for clear understanding of expected behavior
  - Requires standardization of file and function naming

## Current Tasks
- [ ] Implement sandbox testing environment for git operations
  - [ ] Create ./sandbox directory excluded from git tracking
  - [ ] Set up isolation for test repositories
  - [ ] Create cleanup mechanisms for test artifacts
  - [ ] Add safeguards to prevent affecting real repositories
  - [ ] Document the sandbox testing approach

- [ ] Update function tests in ./src/function_tests/
  - [ ] Review and revise to conform to zsh_core_scripting.md
  - [ ] Update to conform to zsh_snippet_scripting.md
  - [ ] Standardize testing approaches
  - [ ] Document test coverage and limitations

- [ ] Fix create_inception_commit.sh testing
  - [ ] Update TEST-create_inception_commit.sh
  - [ ] Modify create_inception_commit.sh to source _Z_Utils.zsh
  - [ ] Remove duplicate functions
  - [ ] Verify script conformance to requirements

- [ ] Implement testing for create_github_remote.sh
  - [ ] Create comprehensive regression test suite
  - [ ] Implement repository protection safeguards
  - [ ] Add remote repository cleanup
  - [ ] Document testing approach

- [ ] Create tests for audit_inception_commit-POC.sh
  - [ ] Develop test suite with various repository conditions
  - [ ] Implement sandbox isolation
  - [ ] Add cleanup mechanisms
  - [ ] Document testing approach

## Key Decisions

## Notes
### Reference Information
- zsh_test_scripting.md contains requirements for regression tests
- z_Output_Demo() offers a good model for functional tests
- TEST-create_inception_commit.sh provides an example of regression testing

### Untracked Files References
<!-- No untracked files yet -->

## Error Recovery
- If script testing becomes too complex, split into multiple branches by script group
- If testing affects repositories, immediately revert changes and improve isolation

## Restart Instructions
To continue this work:
```bash
clause "load CLAUDE.md, verify current branch is feature/test-coverage, load appropriate context, and continue implementation"
```
