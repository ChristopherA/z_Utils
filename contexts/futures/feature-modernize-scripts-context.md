# Feature: Modernize Scripts Context

## Current Status
- Current branch: feature/modernize-scripts
- Not yet started
- Priority: Medium (Parallel Work Stream)

## Scope Boundaries
- Primary Purpose: Modernize Z_Utils scripts to consistently use the library and follow best practices
- In Scope: 
  - Refactor scripts to source _Z_Utils.zsh instead of containing duplicate functions
  - Ensure all scripts follow zsh_core_scripting.md and appropriate snippet/framework requirements
  - Standardize error handling, parameter processing, and output formatting
  - Update create_github_remote.sh to use _Z_Utils.zsh
  - Consolidate create_inception_commit.sh and setup_local_git_inception.sh
- Out of Scope:
  - Adding new functionality to scripts
  - Extensive behavioral changes
  - Modifications to _Z_Utils.zsh core functions
- Dependencies:
  - Can proceed independently but benefits from function documentation and test coverage

## Current Tasks
- [ ] Enforce consistent naming conventions
  - [ ] Script file naming according to zsh_core_scripting.md
  - [ ] Function naming standardization
  - [ ] Variable naming standardization
  - [ ] Verify script categorization (snippet vs framework)

- [ ] Refactor create_github_remote.sh
  - [ ] Update to conform to zsh requirements
  - [ ] Replace embedded functions with _Z_Utils.zsh
  - [ ] Standardize error handling
  - [ ] Document usage and requirements

- [ ] Consolidate inception scripts
  - [ ] Compare create_inception_commit.sh with setup_local_git_inception.sh
  - [ ] Identify valuable elements to incorporate
  - [ ] Create consolidated script
  - [ ] Consider appropriate naming
  - [ ] Deprecate setup_local_git_inception.sh
  - [ ] Update documentation

## Key Decisions

## Notes
### Reference Information
- zsh_core_scripting.md contains base requirements for all scripts
- zsh_snippet_scripting.md applies to most utility scripts
- zsh_framework_scripting.md applies to larger, more complex scripts

### Untracked Files References
<!-- No untracked files yet -->

## Error Recovery
- If script refactoring becomes too complex, break into smaller steps
- If behavior changes occur, revert to original behavior and document separately

## Restart Instructions
To continue this work:
```bash
clause "load CLAUDE.md, verify current branch is feature/modernize-scripts, load appropriate context, and continue refactoring"
```
