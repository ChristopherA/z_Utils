# Feature Enhanced Functionality Context

<!-- 
IMPORTANT DESIGN DECISIONS:
1. This template prioritizes Claude processing efficiency over human readability
2. Direct command execution (git status, etc.) is used for reliable state detection
3. Process blocks use a single, consistent format for Claude's internal use
4. Instructions are self-contained without requiring cross-referencing

## Current Status
- Current branch: feature/enhanced-functionality
- Started: <!-- Will be filled when branch is created -->
- Last updated: 2025-03-31
- Progress: Planned, not started
- Phase: Planning

## Planning

### What We're Solving
We need to extend the Z_Utils library with additional functionality to handle more advanced use cases and improve existing core functions like z_Output().

### Our Approach
We'll enhance the library with new utility functions for advanced logging, configuration management, and process utilities while improving existing core functionality.

### Definition of Done
- [ ] Project requirements updated with function inclusion criteria
- [ ] z_Output() function enhanced with standardized formatting
- [ ] New utility functions implemented and documented
- [ ] Advanced logging capabilities implemented
- [ ] Configuration management functions added

### Implementation Phases
1. Requirements Definition → Function criteria established
2. Core Function Enhancement → z_Output() and related functions improved
3. New Functionality Development → Advanced logging and configuration capabilities added
4. Example Creation → Complex usage examples created

### Approval
- [ ] Planning approved - Ready to implement (YYYY-MM-DD)

## Scope Boundaries
- Primary Purpose: Implement new utility functions to extend Z_Utils capabilities
- In Scope: 
  - Add advanced logging capabilities
  - Implement configuration management functions
  - Add process management utilities
  - Create complex usage examples
  - Document best practices for new functionality
  - Improve z_Output() function and testing
  - Update project requirements for z_* functions
- Out of Scope:
  - Function documentation of existing functions (covered in feature/function-documentation)
  - Test implementation of existing functions (covered in feature/function-test-implementation)
  - Script modernization (covered in feature/modernize-scripts)
  - CI/CD integration (covered in feature/ci-cd-setup)
- Dependencies:
  - Depends on function documentation
  - Depends on function test implementation for core functions

## Key Decisions
<!-- No entries yet -->

## Notes
### Reference Information
- Main library: src/_Z_Utils.zsh
- Example scripts: src/examples/*.sh
- Function tests: src/function_tests/*.sh

### Design Principles
- New functions should follow existing patterns
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Ensure proper error handling
- Document thoroughly
- Include comprehensive tests

## Error Recovery
- If new functionality conflicts with existing functions: Prioritize compatibility
- If dependencies cause issues: Create fallback mechanisms
- If implementation complexity increases: Break into smaller phases

## Restart Instructions
To continue this work:
```bash
claude "load CLAUDE.md, verify current branch is feature/enhanced-functionality, load appropriate context, and continue implementing Z_Utils enhanced features"
```
