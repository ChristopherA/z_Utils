# Feature: Enhanced Functionality Context

## Current Status
- Current branch: feature/enhanced-functionality
- Not yet started
- Priority: Medium (Depends on Test Coverage)

## Scope Boundaries
- Primary Purpose: Enhance Z_Utils with new functions and improvements
- In Scope: 
  - Define clear criteria for what makes a good z_* function
  - Document standards for z_* function implementation
  - Create guidelines for when to refactor script-specific functions
  - Define documentation levels for different function types
  - Extract useful functions from script-specific implementations
  - Improve z_Output() and related functions
- Out of Scope:
  - Major architectural changes
  - Removing existing functionality
  - Changing core behavior of well-established functions
- Dependencies:
  - Requires completion of function documentation and test coverage

## Completed Work

## Current Tasks
- [ ] Update project requirements for z_* functions
  - [ ] Define criteria for inclusion in _Z_Utils.zsh
  - [ ] Document implementation standards and best practices
  - [ ] Create guidelines for function refactoring
  - [ ] Define documentation requirements by function type

- [ ] Improve z_Output() function
  - [ ] Verify latest version is correctly implemented
  - [ ] Enhance with any improvements from recent scripts
  - [ ] Update tests to be comprehensive
  - [ ] Document usage patterns and examples

- [ ] Extract useful functions from scripts
  - [ ] Identify script-specific functions with general utility
  - [ ] Refactor for reusability and consistency
  - [ ] Add to _Z_Utils.zsh with appropriate documentation
  - [ ] Create tests for new functions

## Key Decisions
<!-- No entries yet -->

## Notes
### Reference Information
- _Z_Utils.zsh contains the current library functions
- Various scripts contain functions that could be extracted and generalized
- Function naming should follow z_* convention

### Untracked Files References
<!-- No untracked files yet -->

## Error Recovery
- If function enhancement affects existing behavior, consider backward compatibility
- If unsure about function utility, start with a focused use case

## Restart Instructions
To continue this work:
```bash
clause "load CLAUDE.md, verify current branch is feature/enhanced-functionality, load appropriate context, and continue enhancement"
```
