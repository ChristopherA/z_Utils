# Context: Deprecate Local Git Inception Script

## Purpose and Goal

The purpose of this branch is to properly deprecate the local git inception script:

1. `scripts/setup_local_git_inception.sh` - To be replaced by `src/examples/setup_git_inception_repo.sh`

This is a cleanup task following the refactoring of the inception scripts. The `setup_local_git_inception.sh` script is now redundant and should be properly deprecated.

## Current Status

This task was intended to be part of the previous feature/refactor-inception-script branch but was not completed. It's now identified as a near-term cleanup task.

## Approach

The approach will be straightforward:

1. **Documentation**
   - Update the script with a prominent deprecation notice
   - Add a reference to the new `src/examples/setup_git_inception_repo.sh` script
   - Include migration instructions for users

2. **Testing**
   - Ensure the script still functions but clearly indicates it's deprecated
   - Verify that the replacement script (`setup_git_inception_repo.sh`) covers all functionality

3. **Future Removal Plan**
   - Document a timeline for complete removal
   - Specify the version when the script will be removed entirely

The script was marked as deprecated in the task tracking but needs proper implementation of the deprecation.
