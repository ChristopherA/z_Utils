# Feature Deprecate Local Git Inception Context

<!-- 
IMPORTANT DESIGN DECISIONS:
1. This template prioritizes Claude processing efficiency over human readability
2. Direct command execution (git status, etc.) is used for reliable state detection
3. Process blocks use a single, consistent format for Claude's internal use
4. Instructions are self-contained without requiring cross-referencing

## Current Status
- Current branch: feature/deprecate-local-git-inception
- Started: 2025-03-29
- Last updated: 2025-03-31
- Progress: Planning phase - preparing for implementation
- Phase: Planning

## Planning

### What We're Solving
The setup_local_git_inception.sh script is now redundant after the refactoring work and needs proper deprecation.

### Our Approach
We'll add clear deprecation notices to both locations of the script while ensuring the scripts still function, with redirection to the new replacement script.

### Definition of Done
- [ ] Deprecation notices added to both script locations
- [ ] Migration instructions to setup_git_inception_repo.sh included
- [ ] Testing verifies both scripts still function
- [ ] Future removal timeline documented

### Implementation Phases
1. Documentation → Create deprecation notices and migration instructions
2. Testing → Verify scripts still function with notices
3. Timeline → Document future removal plan
4. Verification → Final review and testing

### Approval
- [ ] Planning approved - Ready to implement (YYYY-MM-DD)

## Purpose and Goal

The purpose of this branch is to properly deprecate the local git inception script:

1. `scripts/setup_local_git_inception.sh` - To be replaced by `src/examples/setup_git_inception_repo.sh`

This is a cleanup task following the refactoring of the inception scripts. The `setup_local_git_inception.sh` script is now redundant and should be properly deprecated.

## Current Status

This task was intended to be part of the previous feature/refactor-inception-script branch but was not completed. It's now identified as a near-term cleanup task.

## Approach

The approach will be straightforward:

1. **Documentation**
   - Update the script with a prominent deprecation notice
   - Add a reference to the new `src/examples/setup_git_inception_repo.sh` script
   - Include migration instructions for users

2. **Testing**
   - Ensure the script still functions but clearly indicates it's deprecated
   - Verify that the replacement script (`setup_git_inception_repo.sh`) covers all functionality

3. **Future Removal Plan**
   - Document a timeline for complete removal
   - Specify the version when the script will be removed entirely

## Branch Information

- **Branch:** feature/deprecate-local-git-inception
- **Created from:** main
- **Merge to:** main

## Related Tasks

This work is a cleanup task related to the previously completed refactoring:

```
- [x] **Consolidate inception scripts** (Completed: 2025-03-24)
  - Acceptance Criteria:
    - ✅ Deprecate setup_local_git_inception.sh
    - ✅ Update documentation
```

The script was marked as deprecated in the task tracking but needs proper implementation of the deprecation.
