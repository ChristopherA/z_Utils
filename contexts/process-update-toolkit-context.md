- [2025-03-22] Added branch-context synchronization emphasis
- [2025-03-22] Added branch completion procedures
- [2025-03-22] Enhanced main-context.md with active branches and PRs sections
- [2025-03-22] Added process branch type to git workflow guide

## Notes
### Reference Information
- The source of updates is `/Users/christophera/Documents/Workspace/github/christophera/z_Utils/untracked/Claude-Code-CLI-Toolkit/`
- Key files that were updated:
  - `requirements/guides/context_guide.md`
  - `requirements/guides/git_workflow_guide.md`
  - `requirements/guides/task_tracking_guide.md`
  - `contexts/main-context.md`
  - `PROJECT_GUIDE.md`
  - `WORK_STREAM_TASKS.md`

### Untracked Files References
This branch uses the following untracked files:
- `untracked/Claude-Code-CLI-Toolkit/` - Source of updated process files
- `contexts/process-update-toolkit-context-analysis.md` - Analysis document

## Error Recovery
- If updates conflict with existing project focus: Maintain Z_Utils-specific content while adopting improved structure
- If context becomes out of sync: Restore from git history
- If conflicts arise with existing branches: Focus on structure updates rather than content changes

## Implementation Summary
This branch incorporates significant process improvements from the updated Claude-Code-CLI-Toolkit, while preserving Z_Utils project-specific content. Key enhancements include:

1. Better branch-context synchronization procedures
2. Improved context file templates with scope boundaries
3. More comprehensive branch protection and workflow guidance
4. Enhanced main branch context structure with active PR and branch tracking
5. Clearer definitions of development models (Team vs Solo)
6. Z_Utils-specific task categories and workflows
7. Process branch type definition and workflow guidance

No changes were made to the actual Z_Utils source code functionality, maintaining the focus on process improvements only.

## PR Readiness
- [x] Self-review completed (2025-03-22)
- [x] Documentation fully updated
- [x] Project-specific content preserved
- [x] Implementation complete
