TASK MANAGEMENT GUIDE: WORK STREAM MANAGEMENT
============================================================================
This section explains the purpose and organization of this task tracking file
and how it integrates with the context-based workflow.
-->

## About Work Stream Tasks

This file tracks all tasks and work streams for the Z_Utils project, providing a centralized overview of completed, in-progress, and planned work. It serves as both a project roadmap and a historical record of project evolution.

> **Note:** For detailed instructions on working with Claude using both explicit commands and natural language patterns, refer to [DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md](./DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md).

### Purpose and Function

- **Project Coordination**: Provides a high-level view of all work streams across the project
- **Status Tracking**: Documents the completion status of all major tasks
- **Dependency Management**: Identifies relationships and dependencies between tasks
- **Implementation Traceability**: Links tasks to implementation details and branches
- **Historical Reference**: Maintains a record of completed work with implementation notes

### Relationship to Context Files

Every task in this file should correspond to one or more context files:

1. **Active tasks** → Active context files in `contexts/`
2. **Future tasks** → Future context files in `contexts/futures/`
3. **Completed tasks** → Archived entries in `contexts/archived.md`

### Task Status Conventions

Tasks use the following status indicators:
- `[ ]` - Not started
- `[~]` - In progress (always include start date)
- `[x]` - Completed (always include completion date)

### Maintaining This File

When working with this file:
1. Update task status as work progresses
2. Include dates for all status changes (YYYY-MM-DD format)
3. Document implementation details for completed tasks
4. Ensure consistency between this file and context files
5. Move completed tasks to the Completed Tasks section with minimal details
6. Archive completed tasks to contexts/archived.md for detailed history

## Development Process

1. When starting a task, move it to the appropriate branch section
2. Mark tasks in progress with [~] and add start date in YYYY-MM-DD format
3. Mark completed tasks with [x] and add completion date in YYYY-MM-DD format
4. Document implementation details for completed tasks
5. When creating a branch, ensure its context file is created simultaneously
6. Before completing a branch, update its context file with completion status
7. When a task is completed:
   - Add the detailed entry to contexts/archived.md
   - Replace the detailed entry in this file with a reference to archived.md
   - Update relevant context files

## Task Dependencies and Critical Path

### Critical Path Components:
1. Core Infrastructure and Standards (foundation for all other work)
2. Function Documentation (essential for understanding behavior)
3. Test Coverage (builds on documentation for reliable enhancement)
4. Enhanced Functionality (relies on solid documentation and testing)

### Primary Task Dependencies:
- Function Documentation → Test Coverage (recommended sequence)
- Function Documentation + Test Coverage → Enhanced Functionality (required)
- Test Coverage → CI/CD Pipeline (required for automated testing)

### Independent Work Streams:
- Script modernization (can proceed independently)
- Task organization (can proceed independently)
- Documentation improvements (can proceed in parallel with other tasks)
