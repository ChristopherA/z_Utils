## Development Process

1. When starting a task, move it to the appropriate branch section
2. Mark tasks in progress with [~] and add start date in YYYY-MM-DD format
3. Mark completed tasks with [x] and add completion date in YYYY-MM-DD format
4. Document implementation details for completed tasks
5. When creating a branch, ensure its context file is created simultaneously
6. Before completing a branch, update its context file with completion status

## Task Dependencies and Critical Path

### Critical Path Components:
1. Core Infrastructure and Standards (foundation for all other work)
2. Function Documentation (essential for understanding behavior)
3. Test Coverage (builds on documentation for reliable enhancement)
4. Enhanced Functionality (relies on solid documentation and testing)

### Primary Task Dependencies:
- Function Documentation → Test Coverage (recommended sequence)
- Function Documentation + Test Coverage → Enhanced Functionality (required)
- Test Coverage → CI/CD Pipeline (required for automated testing)

### Independent Work Streams:
- Script modernization (can proceed independently)
- Task organization (can proceed independently)
- Documentation improvements (can proceed in parallel with other tasks)
