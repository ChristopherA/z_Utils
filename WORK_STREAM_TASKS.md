- [x] Set up basic project structure (2025-03-19)
- [x] Define initial architecture (2025-03-19)
- [x] Implement core utility functions (2025-03-19)

## Branch: organize/task-planning-and-context-creation

- [~] **Task Organization** (started 2025-03-22)
  - [~] Review and update WORK_STREAM_TASKS.md structure (started 2025-03-22)
  - [~] Create context files for future branches (started 2025-03-22)

## Development Process

1. When starting a task, move it to the appropriate branch section
2. Mark tasks in progress with [~] and add start date in YYYY-MM-DD format
3. Mark completed tasks with [x] and add completion date in YYYY-MM-DD format
4. Document implementation details for completed tasks
5. When creating a branch, ensure its context file is created simultaneously
6. Before completing a branch, update its context file with completion status

## Task Dependencies and Critical Path

### Critical Path Components:
1. Documentation of existing functions (required for clear understanding and effective reuse)
2. Test coverage for core functions (required for ensuring reliability and enabling enhanced functionality)

### Primary Task Dependencies:
- Function Documentation → Test Coverage (recommended sequence)
- Function Documentation + Test Coverage → Enhanced Functionality (required)
- Test Coverage → CI/CD Pipeline (required for automated testing)

### Independent Work Streams:
- Script modernization (can proceed independently)
- Task organization (can proceed independently)
- Documentation improvements (can proceed in parallel with other tasks)
