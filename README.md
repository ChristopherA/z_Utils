## Project Overview

Z_Utils is a collection of reusable Zsh utility functions designed to provide consistent, robust, and efficient scripting capabilities. This library helps maintain high-quality shell scripting practices across projects.

## Purpose

Z_Utils serves two main purposes:

1. **Consistent Scripting**: Provide reusable functions for reliable shell scripting
2. **Best Practices**: Implement shell scripting best practices in a reusable format

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Source the library in your Zsh scripts: `source /path/to/_Z_Utils.zsh`
3. Use Z_Utils functions in your scripts: `z_Output info "Hello, World!"`

## Key Features

- **Output Management**: Standardized output with formatting, colors, and emoji support
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error reporting and propagation
- **Environment Setup**: Script environment initialization and validation
- **Dependency Checking**: Verify required tools and commands
- **Path Management**: Utilities for handling file paths
- **Resource Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup of temporary resources

## Utility Functions

The library includes several core utility functions:

- `z_Output`: Standardized formatted output with multiple message types
- `z_Report_Error`: Centralized error reporting
- `z_Check_Dependencies`: Verify required external commands
- `z_Ensure_Parent_Path_Exists`: Create parent directories as needed
- `z_Setup_Environment`: Initialize script environment
- `z_Cleanup`: Handle script termination cleanup
- `z_Convert_Path_To_Relative`: Convert paths to user-friendly formats

## Development Workflow

The Z_Utils project follows a structured development process with:

- Detailed requirements documentation
- Function-level tests
- Comprehensive example scripts
- Task tracking in WORK_STREAM_TASKS.md
